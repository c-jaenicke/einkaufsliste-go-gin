# shopping-list-go-gin

A simple shopping list webapp for managing items that should be bought.

## Authentication

**There is no built-in authentication!**

You should put the site behind [Authelia (authelia.com)](https://www.authelia.com/) or another authentication service to
protect it.

Everyone that has access to the site can change the entries!

## Database

The site requires a PostgreSQL database to save entries.

Possibly more database connectors in the future.

## Icons

All used icons are taken from [https://feathericons.com/](https://feathericons.com/)
